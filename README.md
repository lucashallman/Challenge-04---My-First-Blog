## My First Blog

This is a blog site which functions based on the user's local storage.

The user can submit a post from the index. They are then redirected to a display page with all of their posts.
The user can then hit the back button to return to the post form, make another post, and view the display page again.
The console lists all existing post data in your local storage, as well as a binary for the dark mode indicator.
